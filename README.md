### The goal of the task is to:
- practice working with tuples and deconstruction in C#

### Steps
1. Fork the repo to have your own copy and then clone it to your local disc
2. Open Waypoint.cs. Implement the class content so that tests in the WaypointTests.cs file are passing. For this you need to
   - add a constructor which will accept respective parameters and store them in some way (you decide how)
   - add GetCoordinates() method which returns tuple with coordinates
   - add Deconstruct method so that the Waypoint class can be deconstructed into two coordinates
